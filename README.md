Stella-Engine
=============

Modular N-body physics simulation engine designed for computational efficiency under intensive situations. Engine functionality is directed towards eliminating the appearance of Newtonian Mechanics (Rail-Based Physics Simulations) for visible systems, while still allowing systems to operate within plausible limits of memory consumption and processing time.

Development Cycle
=================

#Stage-I Development

**CURRENT**

Development focused on fundamental operation of the engine, including implementation of the module system framework. Primary objective of this stage is the implementation of the Abstraction Protocol for memory management.

#Stage-II Development

Development focused on development of the N-body simulation. Primary objective of this stage is the implementation of fluid transitions between simulation stages.

#Stage-III Development

Development focused on refining the simulation framework and increasing modularity of the system.

Objectives
=========

#In Progress

- [] Small-System Container Hierarchy; system still requires refinement and extensive testing (65%)
- [] Large-Scale Container Hierarchy; system still requires implementation (10%)
- [] Basic OpenGL Framework (10%)

#To be Started

- Physics Engine
- Rendering Hierarchy
- Abstraction Protocol
- Module Loading Framework
