#Stella-Engine

Modular simulation framework designed for computational efficiency under intensive situations. Engine functionality is directed towards providing computationally accurate results for massive scale systems, while simultaneously reducing the load requirements for object operations.

##Abstract

The Stella Engine is designed to introduce object management methods into a simulation framework. This is achieved through the introduction of location-based abstraction protocols. Compared to conventional abstraction methods used in similar environments, the Constance Abstraction Protocol simplifies several aspects of the simulation engine based on the level of intelligibility of the abstraction. Simply, this means that if performing an abstraction would diminish the appearance of accuracy, the abstraction will not be performed at this level.

##Development Cycle

###Stage-I Development
(**_Current Stage_**)

Development focused on fundamental operation of the engine, including implementation of the module and object management frameworks. Primary objective of this stage is the implementation of the Abstraction Protocol for memory management.

###Stage-II Development

Development focused on development of simulation framework. Primary objective of this stage is the implementation of fluid transitions between simulation stages.

###Stage-III Development

Development focused on refining the simulation framework and increasing modularity of the system.

##Objectives

##Project Status

Stella is being developed by a small team of engineers and physicists. However, due to various constraints, the team is unable to dedicate all of its time to an unpaid project. As a result, progress will be slower than desired for the next few months.
