Stella-Engine
=============

Orbital mechanic and interplanetary communication simulation engine. 

Development Cycle
=================
Stage-I development will be directed towards a rudimentary N-body simulation at the interplanetary scale.

Stage-II Development will focus on stellar interactions at the galactic scale.

Stage-III development will focus on implementation of an accurate N-body simulation.

Current Status
==============

The engine is currently in Stage-I Development. The intent is to complete the initial framework for N-Body simulation before progressing towards larger cosmic interactions.
