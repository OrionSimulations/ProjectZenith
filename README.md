#Zenith Project

Modular simulation library and engine designed for computational efficiency under intensive situations. Engine functionality is directed towards providing computationally accurate results for massive scale systems, while simultaneously reducing the load requirements for object operations.

##Latest News

The Zenith Project is back from a long hiatus, with an updated project objective and an official name-change! The project is now under the management of the Orion Virtualization Systems Simulations team, which should see a more structured layout for system implementation. The project scope has also been expanded to allow for universal content development, while maintaining the objective simplicity and efficiency of the original Zenith library.

##Abstract

The Zenith Library is designed to introduce object management methods into a simulation framework. This is achieved through the introduction of location-based abstraction protocols. Compared to conventional abstraction methods used in similar environments, the Constance Abstraction Protocol simplifies several aspects of the simulation engine based on the level of intelligibility of the abstraction. Simply, this means that if performing an abstraction would diminish the appearance of accuracy, the abstraction will not be performed at this level.

The Zenith Engine implements the Zenith Library, and introduces a set of content-developer tools for ease of use. These tools will initially include a rendering subsystem for data display, and a C++-based API for objective scripting. As the project progresses, more language API's will be developed, including a planned Language-Agnostic API Library.

##Objectives

###Zenith Library

 - [ 20% ] - Object Management Framework
 - [ 75% ] - Module Loading Framework
 - [ 25% ] - Asset Loading Framework 
 - [ 10% ] - Abstraction Protocol

###Zenith Engine
 - [ 10% ] - Rendering Subsystem
 - [  0% ] - Zenith API (C++)
 - [  0% ] - Zenith Interpreter (C++)

##Project Status

Due to the recently expanded scope of the project, the team will be focusing on the Zenith Library's Core Frameworks until they are deemed stable enough for an initial alpha release.
